# ApplyFlow

**AI-assisted job application tracking & tailoring.**

ApplyFlow lets candidates track job applications through their lifecycle and
uses an LLM (via LangChain) to score a resume against a job description and
draft a tailored cover letter. Heavy AI work runs asynchronously through
Celery + Redis, and data is persisted in PostgreSQL.

## Clean Architecture

This project follows **Clean Architecture**. Source code lives under `src/`
split into four layers. **Dependencies only ever point inward.**

```
interfaces  ──►  application  ──►  domain
infrastructure ─►  application  ──►  domain
```

### `src/domain/` — the core (depends on nothing)
Pure business logic with zero third-party imports.
- `entities/` — `JobApplication` (aggregate root, protects its own invariants)
- `value_objects/` — `ApplicationStatus` (state machine), `EmailAddress`, `MatchScore`
- `repositories/` — `JobApplicationRepository` **interface** (WHAT, not HOW)
- `services/` — `ApplicationRankingService` (pure domain logic)
- `exceptions.py` — domain exceptions

### `src/application/` — use cases (depends only on domain)
Orchestrates the domain to fulfill use cases. No DB, HTTP, or LLM code.
- `use_cases/` — one class per use case, each with an `execute(dto)` method
  (`CreateJobApplication`, `AnalyzeJobApplication`, `SubmitJobApplication`,
  `ListCandidateApplications`, `GetLlmCompletion`)
- `dtos/` — input/output contracts (entities never cross the boundary)
- `ports/` — outbound abstractions (`ResumeAnalyzerPort`, `TaskQueuePort`,
  `IdGeneratorPort`, `AuthVerifierPort`, `LlmClientPort`) implemented by
  infrastructure
- `mappers/` — domain ↔ DTO translation

### `src/infrastructure/` — implementations (depends on domain + application)
All I/O lives here. Implements the interfaces defined further in.
- `persistence/` — SQLAlchemy models + `SqlAlchemyJobApplicationRepository`
  (implements the domain repository interface, maps rows ↔ entities)
- `llm/` — `LangChainResumeAnalyzer` (implements `ResumeAnalyzerPort`) and
  `AnthropicLlmClient` (implements `LlmClientPort` — the app's single LLM
  integration; see below)
- `tasks/` — Celery app, tasks, and `CeleryTaskQueue` (implements `TaskQueuePort`)
- `services/` — `UuidIdGenerator` (implements `IdGeneratorPort`)
- `auth/` — `SupabaseJwtVerifier` (implements `AuthVerifierPort`)
- `config.py` — the **only** place environment variables are read

### `src/interfaces/` — entry points (depends on application)
Thin adapters that translate external input into use case calls.
- `http/` — FastAPI app, controllers, request/response schemas
- `http/dependencies.py` — the **composition root** where concrete
  infrastructure adapters are injected into abstract ports
- `cli/` — a command-line entry point demonstrating a non-HTTP adapter

> The dependency rule is enforced by convention and documented in each
> layer's `CLAUDE.md`, plus `architecture.json` at the repo root.

## Provisioning the database & auth (Supabase)

Local development runs against the Postgres container in `docker-compose.yml`
by default — no external account is needed to hack on the app. Staging and
production point at a [Supabase](https://supabase.com) free-tier project
instead, which provides both the Postgres database and the single-user auth
provider.

1. Create a free project at supabase.com (Dashboard → New project).
2. **Database connection** — Project Settings → Database → Connection string
   → "Transaction pooler" (asyncpg-compatible). Convert it to the
   `postgresql+asyncpg://` scheme and append `?ssl=require`, then set it as
   `DATABASE_URL`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql+asyncpg://postgres.<project-ref>:<password>@aws-0-<region>.pooler.supabase.com:6543/postgres?ssl=require
   ```
3. **Auth** — Authentication → Providers → enable Email, then Authentication →
   Users → add the one user this app supports. Copy Project Settings → API →
   values into:
   ```
   SUPABASE_URL=https://<project-ref>.supabase.co
   SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=<Project Settings -> API -> JWT Settings -> JWT Secret>
   ```
4. Apply the baseline migration against the new database: `alembic upgrade head`.
5. The frontend authenticates via Supabase Auth's password sign-in and sends
   the resulting access token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` on every
   `/api/applications*` request — the API verifies its signature against
   `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` (`src/infrastructure/auth/supabase_jwt_verifier.py`)
   before any use case runs.

No credentials are ever hard-coded — everything above is read through
`src/infrastructure/config.py` (see `.env.example`), and `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
is required outside of `ENVIRONMENT=development`.

---

## LLM integration layer

`src/infrastructure/llm/anthropic_client.py`'s `AnthropicLlmClient` is the
**only** module in the codebase that talks to the Anthropic API. Every
LLM-backed feature depends on the `LlmClientPort` abstraction
(`src/application/ports/llm_client_port.py`) and receives this adapter from a
composition root — nothing else imports the `anthropic` SDK directly.

- **Auth**: a pay-as-you-go API key from
  [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys), read
  from config as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` and passed explicitly as `api_key=` when
  constructing the client. Subscription/claude.ai login credentials are never
  used — there is no code path that reads an OAuth session or the `claude`
  CLI's stored credentials.
- **Required outside development**: like the other provider secrets,
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` must be set whenever `ENVIRONMENT` isn't `development`
  (enforced in `src/infrastructure/config.py`).

### Model routing (cost control)

Callers never name a model — they pass a **task type**
(`LlmTaskType`, `src/application/ports/llm_client_port.py`) describing what
the prompt is *for*, and the layer picks the model. This keeps cost control
in one place: nobody can accidentally point a high-volume call at the
expensive model by passing the wrong string, because there's no model
string to pass.

| Task type               | Tier   | Default model                | Rationale                                   |
| ------------------------ | ------ | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `extraction`              | cheap  | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`  | High-volume, low-ambiguity                   |
| `matching`                 | cheap  | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`  | High-volume, low-ambiguity                   |
| `parsing`                  | cheap  | `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`  | High-volume, low-ambiguity                   |
| `resume_writing`           | strong | `claude-sonnet-5`             | Quality-sensitive, low-volume writing        |
| `cover_letter_writing`     | strong | `claude-sonnet-5`             | Quality-sensitive, low-volume writing        |

- **Default routing**: `TASK_TYPE_TIERS` in `llm_client_port.py` is the one
  place that maps a task type to a tier (`LlmModelTier.CHEAP` /
  `LlmModelTier.STRONG`). It's an application-layer policy decision — it
  doesn't know or care which provider/model implements each tier.
- **Overrides**: which concrete model backs each tier is config, not code —
  override via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_CHEAP` / `ANTHROPIC_MODEL_STRONG` (e.g. to
  point "strong" at a newer Sonnet snapshot, or "cheap" at a cheaper model)
  without touching any call site. `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS` applies to both
  tiers.

Try the full path end-to-end with the CLI, which wires
`AnthropicLlmClient` → `GetLlmCompletion` (the generic use case every future
LLM feature can call through) and lets you pick the task type:

```bash
python -m src.interfaces.cli.main llm-ping --task-type extraction \
  --prompt "Say hello in one word."
python -m src.interfaces.cli.main llm-ping --task-type resume_writing \
  --prompt "Draft one sentence of a cover letter opener."
```

Unit tests (`tests/infrastructure/test_anthropic_llm_client.py`,
`tests/application/test_get_llm_completion.py`) mock the SDK so `pytest`
never makes a network call or spends money — including dedicated tests that
every cheap-tier task type resolves to the cheap model and every
strong-tier one resolves to the strong model. To prove real completions
from both tiers against Anthropic's API, run the opt-in live test with a
real key:

```bash
RUN_LIVE_LLM_TEST=1 ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-... \
  pytest tests/infrastructure/test_anthropic_llm_client_live.py
```

---

## Data-access layer

`src/infrastructure/persistence/database.py` owns the one process-wide
connection pool (`engine` / `async_session_factory`), so no later feature
opens its own connection. It's sized from config (`DB_POOL_SIZE`,
`DB_MAX_OVERFLOW`, `DB_POOL_RECYCLE_SECONDS`), pings a connection before
handing it out (`pool_pre_ping=True`), and disables asyncpg's server-side
prepared-statement cache (`statement_cache_size=0`) so the same code works
whether `DATABASE_URL` points at local Postgres or Supabase's PgBouncer
transaction-pooler — a plain Postgres connection ignores that setting, so
it's safe either way. `dispose_engine()` is called from the FastAPI
`lifespan` on shutdown so pooled connections are released cleanly instead
of leaking until the process exits.

Every aggregate gets typed read/write helpers the same way
`SqlAlchemyJobApplicationRepository` does: implement the domain-defined
repository interface (`src/domain/repositories/`), taking an `AsyncSession`
via the constructor and mapping rows ↔ entities — never leak an ORM model
past that class.

`tests/infrastructure/test_persistence_smoke.py` proves the whole path
against a **real** database — not a fake — by creating, reading, and
deleting a `JobApplication` row through the repository. It skips (instead
of failing) if nothing is reachable at `DATABASE_URL`, so `pytest` still
runs without Postgres up; start one locally with `docker compose up db` (or
point `DATABASE_URL` at any reachable Postgres) to have it actually run.
CI provisions a Postgres service container so it always executes there.

## Testing

Tests mirror the layer structure and use in-memory fakes for ports, proving
the domain and application layers are decoupled from infrastructure:

```
tests/domain/        # entities & value objects (no I/O)
tests/application/   # use cases with fake repos/ports
```

```bash
pytest
```
